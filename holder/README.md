# Holder

We've finally finished the designing and testing process of our holder model, it contains screw pillars and a housing for your speaker.

 - Screw pillars are designed for any M2 screws (same size of the touchpad hole) within 7mm length.
 - The speaker housing includes 7 air holes and an internal support material to increase resonance, the bottom with air holes also acts like a mask to protect the diaphragm of speaker.

[holder_model-Main_Holder_STL.stl][stl] is the latest STL model you can print directly
[holder_model.blend][blend] is our project file made with Blender
