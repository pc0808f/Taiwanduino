# Holder  

We've finally finished the designing and testing process of our holder model, it contains screw pillars and a housing for  your speaker.  
  
 - screw pillars are designed for any M2 screws (same size of the touchpad hole) within 7mm length.  
 - the speaker housing includes 7 air holes and a internal support material to increase resonance, the bottom with air holes also act like a mask to protect the diaphragm of speaker.  

 [holder_model-Main_Holder_STL.stl] [stl] is the latest STL model you can print directly  
 [holder_model.blend] [blend] is our project file made with Blender
